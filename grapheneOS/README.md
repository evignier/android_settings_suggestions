## GrapheneOS Overview
- GrapheneOS is an open-source privacy and security-focused mobile operating system based on the Android Open-Source Project (AOSP) which is the open-source version of Android that provides the core operating system and framework, but does not come with proprietary Google apps or services.

- While it can run Android apps, GrapheneOS does not include Google Play Services by default, which helps to reduce reliance on Google and its data collection practices.
## Why I need GrapheneOS
- A few years ago, I became frustrated with relying on closed ecosystems that required a Google or Apple account to use a mobile device. What I appreciate most about GrapheneOS is the minimalism of a clean installation without Google Services. I maintain digital hygiene through the habit of regularly resetting my devices.

- GrapheneOS introduced me to the world of open source and the importance of finding alternatives to the Play Store. Two of the most useful tools I discovered for transitioning away from proprietary software were [alternativeto.net](https://alternativeto.net) and [Obtainium](#obtainium).
